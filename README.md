# Computer Science Projects
This repository contains a sample of the most meaningful CS projects I wrote as an undergraduate student at San Diego State University. These projects are in several languages including Java, Assembly Language, Python.


# Data Structures (JAVA)

For my data structures class, I only included a single project of the ones we wrote in the class, because it encompasses many of the possible data structures useful to form a DNS resolver, which includes two sample testing files with up to a million DNS records. The data structures used in this project are a HashMap and a LinkedList.

# Programming Languages

In this class we encountered many different types of programming languages. In this sample I only included programs written in Python, Scheme and Fortran 95. But we also programmed in C, C++ and Java.

The programs in this folder include:
The famous travelling salesman problem written in FORTRAN 95. 
A matrix calculator written in Python.
A scheme program containing many functions, some of which use recursion (palindrome, Index of odds & even numbers in a given list)

# Assembly Language

Contains code written for the Motorola 68000 family, and includes a DateFormatter program that showcases the manipulation of memory in assembly language as well as reading input and condition checking.

It also includes a Prime Number validator that given a valid base 10 number will tell us if it is a prime number or not.

Lastly, findMin allows us to find the minimum value within an array by using a recursive subroutine called within the main file.
